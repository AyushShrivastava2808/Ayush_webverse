<!-- n HTML5, a semantic tag is an element that conveys meaning about the type of content it contains. Instead of just defining how something looks, semantic tags tell browsers, developers, and search engines what the content actually represents.
For example:
- <header> → defines the top section of a page (like a title or navigation).
- <main> → represents the main content of the document.
- <section> → groups related content into a thematic block.
- <article> → represents a self-contained piece of content (like a blog post or news article).
- <footer> → defines the bottom section (like contact info or copyright).
- <nav> → specifically for navigation links.
- <aside> → for side content (like a sidebar or ads).
- <figure> and <figcaption> → for images with captions.
